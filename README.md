# AnotherNoteTaker
local note taker

## Description

note taking app not connected to internet so notes are stored locally

## Getting Started

* cd into client

### Dependencies

* "express": "^4.17.1",
* "if-env": "^1.0.4"

#### Side note
I had a really hard time with this and it unfortunately could not be deployed on heroku. The error was it couldn"t find html-webpack-plugin. Upon looking online I found a post that said heroku doesn't run devdependencies and you have to add in scripts "heroku-prebuild: npm install --dev" but alas it didn't work and the class is almost over so I just have to turn in what I have. In the grading comment could you tell me how to fix that if you know. Thanks!
